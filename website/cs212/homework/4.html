		<h1 align="center">The Perplexing Peculiar Problem of Piping Pot</h1>
		<p>  The world loves to advance, whether it comes as the next iPhone or the invention of faster, more efficienct transportation methods. Currently in medicine, however, there is a development that is being questioned as to whether it should become the next step. Doctors have suggested that cannabis, a drug otherwise known as "weed" or "pot", should be used more often for diagnosing patients because of their pain-numbing qualities and other beneficial factors. However, many have also opposed to this suggestion due to the obsessive nature of cannabis, as well as the common harmful side-effects of the drug becoming more frequent. This has become a huge point of interest, and has split up those involved into two groups: supporters and opposers.
	       </p>
	       <h2>THE SUPPORTERS VIEW</h2>
	       <p> A big reason for why supporters wish for medical marijuana to be adopted into common medical practices is because of the strong pain-relieving properties it contains. In a study found in, "Are cannabinoids an effective and safe treatment option in the management of pain?", which focused on the medical effects of cannabis compared to placebo, they concluded that, "Results consistently indicated that cannabis significantly reduced pain intensity, with patients reporting 34%-40% decrease on cannabis compared to 17%-20% on placebo," (Campbell). These results show that cannabis is an improvement to the current treatments that are being given out. Many opposers point out the bad side effects that may have a significant impact on modern society, especially concerning traffic problems, to combat this ideal. However, supporters point out that the use of cannabis is not any more dangerous on the roads than the consumption of alcohol. When studeis were done that compared the dangers of drunk drivers to drivers that have consumed pot, shown in the article, "The effect of cannabis compared with alcohol on driving", it was shown that, "...Cannabis may acutely impair several driving-related skills in a dose-related fashion, but that the effects between individuals vary more than they do with alcohol because of tolerance, differences in smoking technique, and different absorptions of THC," (Sewell). While marijuana does inhibit drivers from being able to perform safe-driving tactics, there is more variety in how much it harms the individual's driving skills. Alcohol is more consistent in its harm, displaying that neither seems to be a greater threat than the other in terms of traffic safety. Thus, the legality of pot won't change the common state of traffic problems any more than it currently is, breaking up that argument of restricting pot from being usd. Opposers, however, show that doesn't mean there's no downsides to this implementation other than traffic. 
	       </p>
	       <h2>THE OPPOSERS VIEW</h2>
	       <p>
	      Cannabis opposers point out the addictive quality of the drog as a strong negative side-effect of making it legal. A study found in "Substance misuse treatment for high-risk chronic pain patients on opiod therapy: a randomized trail" that focused on the addictions that pot can cause in patients states that, "Significant differences were found between groups with 73.% of the High-Risk Control patients demonstrating positive scores on the DMI," (Hamison). The referenced "DMI" stands for Drug Misuse Index, a report that determines addiction levels in a patient based on self-reports, physicaian reports, and urine samples. Due to the use of the opiod in the trial, the patients had become addicted to the substance, which provides harm to the individual and those affected by them. However, it should be pointed out that, with counseling and other measures, this can become significantly reduced. Another problem that has been presented by those who oppose it's recreation in medicine point out the many harmful side effects it can cause, questioning if the cure is worse than the sickness. A group of professional nurses and anaesthetists studied multiple reports of marijuana-treated subjects, and concluded that, "Adverse effects associated with the cannabinoids were common and sometimes severe in six of the eight trials that showed efficacy. The predominant adveerse effect seemed to be depression of the central nervous system," (Campbell). Cannabis, like any other drug, has side affects that aren't helpfulto the consumer if taken out of hand, though differing in that these side-effects are more dangerous than other common ones found in other, safer drugs. With all of these downsides, the drug should stay out of medical treatments and should leave the current treatments in use. From what is shown here, a reasonable conclusion would be to allow for the use of marijuana in the medical field, but it needs to be strongly observed and protected from theft, and those prescribing the drug should take into account the background of the patient concerning cannabis usage, along with the potential risk factors, and deny pot as a prescription if the patient is at a high risk of addiction.

	       <h2>COMPROMISE?</h2>
	       <p>
	       Seeing as pot does not retain significant medical value, and is not any more harmful than the effects of alcohol in terms of usage, it's inclusion will be beneficial to medicine. However, as it is still very harmful and has strong addictive effects, careful observation of the drug, in terms of security and storage, needs to occur. The risk level of a patient, as well as their past experience with the drug itself, needs to be accounted for when prescribing, and those where the individual in charge of the prescription feel would gain more harm than help should stick with the common treatments currently used. For example, as patients with experience with the drug seem to withstand some of the negative effects, they can be prescribed higher doses than individuals that have not consumed pot before (Grant). As cannabis is sought out for it's "high", there needs to be some form of security making sure that the substanced is not stolen/abused, and storage supplies need to be checked regularly in order to prevent misuse. The usage of pot is allowed, but needs to be kept in balance to avoid future problems as much as possible.
	       </p>
	       <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
	       <p>
	       Pot has been and will most likely stay a controversial topic due to the many complex factors that go into the medical field, as well as the political morality of enacting such a drug into common practice. The reward can definitely improve medicine and treatment, but localizing it may cause problems out of our control. Yet, other common substances that could lead to strong harm, like cigarettes and alcohol, have yet to become outlawed, so meth may fit in with that category. However, as it is dangerous, it needs to be monitored. As long as proper surveillance of the storage of cannabis in medical facilities, as well as care towards evaluating individuals is maintained, marijuana should be allowed into distribution as a clinical treatment.

	<h1 align="center">Addendum</h1>
	<p> For this assignment, I tried to "prettify" my essay by making it more interesting and nice to look at (i.e. older internet website styles). For the fonts, I decided to use google fonts in order to differentiate the headings from the paragraphs (headings were Playfair Display, paragraphs were Doris). They looked nice and formal enough to fit the content of the essay. I (attempted) to make the headings way larger than the main text so that it could stand out and be easily seen, the h1's being 30px, the h2's being 25, and the normal text being 20px. I kept the ordered list the same just so the links were also differentiated from the actual essay. For color, I decided a nice tan for the background and some green headings in order to fit with the theme of cannabis. I kept the text itself the same color so it was easier to read, and I'm too scared to find a good color that'd also be easier to read as well as fit the color scheme. For margins and paddings, the entire html should have a margin of 40px to make the text more central. Headings and paragraphs should also have margins to help with this process.
