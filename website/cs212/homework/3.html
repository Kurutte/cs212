		<h1>A FONT SLITHERS BY</h1>
		<p>
		In order to get the font here, I first had to find a font I wanted to use. I looked for a free font on <a href="fontsquirrel.com">fontsquirrel.com</a>.	After making sure all legal stuff was taken care of (was free for personal/commercial use), I then downloaded the font. Then, I had to make a font-face block in my css stylesheet, then give it a name and put a src element that directed it to where I downloaded the font. Finally, I put the font family inside the html element for this page so that you could see all the snakes you could possibly see.
