				<p> This project I had the most trouble with by far, but moreso just because I couldn't find a way to see my site updated. i would change the files around and try to make it better, but because I didn't realize I wasn't hard refreshing the site, none of my changes showed. Luckily contacting Mr. Nakai and getting help from the discord taught me the valuable ctrl-shift-r technique and now I can see what I'm actually doing.  </p>
				<p>For the Holy Grail Layout, I did have a little trouble with flexbox trying to get it to work, but then I switched to gridbox due to a suggestion in the discord and I got it to work well. As for the scripting, I ran into problems concerning the act I had a semicolon ending every line, which removing seemed to help, and I had trouble getting the input to actually add it to the sum. However, finding the getElementByID.value (according to the internet) helped me solve that quickly. The other problem I had was turning numbers into strings and vice versa, which I was able to solve by adding "" to make sure the number was a string and by using the Number() method to make the "number string" into just an integer that could be added into the sum. </p>
